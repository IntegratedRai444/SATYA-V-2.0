# Legacy Code Archive

This directory contains legacy/duplicate code from SATYA-V-2.0-main that has been archived as part of the project cleanup and unification process.

## Why Archive?
- The active backend code is now located in the `backend/` directory.
- All routes, models, and utils in this folder are superseded by the versions in `backend/`.
- No unique or advanced logic was found in these legacy files that is not present in the backend.

## How to Restore
If you need to restore any file, simply copy it from this directory back to its original location.
