Full Prompt for SatyaAI UI Design
Objective:
Design a modern, sleek, and highly intuitive UI for SatyaAI, an advanced deepfake detection system. The interface should enable users to easily upload media (images, videos, audio), perform real-time webcam analysis, view detailed results with confidence scores, and access logs/history. It must be visually appealing, professional, and optimized for usability by both casual and expert users.

Core Features to include:

Landing/Dashboard Page

Welcome banner with SatyaAI logo and tagline (e.g., “Synthetic Authentication Technology for Your Analysis”)

Quick access buttons for each media type: Image, Video, Audio, Webcam

Recent scan history or log overview

Navigation bar with links to Home, Scan, History, Settings, Help

Media Upload & Scan Interface

Drag and drop or browse file upload for Image, Video, Audio

Webcam live feed with Start/Stop capture button

Scan button to initiate deepfake detection

Progress bar or loading animation during analysis

Results Display Panel

Clear, color-coded confidence score (e.g., green = authentic, red = fake)

Detailed breakdown of detection methods (e.g., facial landmarks, audio spectral analysis, frame anomalies)

Visual aids like heatmaps, graphs, or waveforms showing suspicious regions

Option to save/export reports as PDF or CSV

History & Logs Page

List of all previous scans with date/time, media type, and result summary

Ability to filter/search past scans

Click to expand detailed report for each scan

Settings & Customization

User preferences for alert thresholds, scan sensitivity

Option to toggle between light/dark mode

Language selection

Help & Support Section

FAQ about deepfake detection and SatyaAI technology

Contact/support form or chatbot for assistance

Design Guidelines:

Use a dark theme with neon accent colors (electric blue, cyan, lime green, red for warnings) to convey a futuristic and tech-savvy vibe.

Clean typography with easy-to-read fonts (e.g., Poppins, Roboto, or Open Sans).

Intuitive layout with minimal clutter, clear call-to-action buttons, and responsive design for desktop and tablet.

Subtle animations/transitions for buttons, loading states, and results.

Use icons and graphical elements to visually represent media types and detection stages.

Ensure accessibility: good contrast ratios, keyboard navigability, and screen reader support.

Example UI Sections (for inspiration):

Header: SatyaAI logo + navigation + user profile icon

Sidebar (optional): Scan types, History, Settings

Main Content: Dynamic based on selected media scan or history view

Footer: Version info, links to GitHub/repo, privacy policy

Bonus:
If possible, add an AI assistant widget on the side that guides the user through uploading and scanning, explaining terms in layman’s language.
